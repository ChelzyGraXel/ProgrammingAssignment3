# Programming Assignment 3
### Problem 1: Cars Data Frame
#### STEP 1: Import the Pandas Library
Firstly, I have imported the pandas as pd to be able to access the Pandas library.
#### STEP 2: Load the .csv file into the Data Frame
As I try to use the syntax "pd.read_csv('cars.csv')", it displays that an error has occurred. Then, I suddenly remembered that the cars.csv file must be on the same folder as the Jupyter notebook. After moving the cars.csv file on the same folder of my Jupyter NB file, I successfully imported the data and have assigned it to a variable named "Cars_XLS_Worksheet".
#### STEP 3: Display the First Five Rows
By utilizing the syntax "Cars_XLS_Worksheet.head(5)", it directly displays the first five rows in the data frame.
#### STEP 4: Display the Last Five Rows
In displaying the last five rows of the data frame, it almost has the same syntax as what was used in printing the first five rows. However, instead of using ".head()", ".tail()" is used.

### Problem 2: Subsetting, Slicing, and Indexing
#### STEP 1: Import the Pandas Library
Firstly, I have imported the pandas as pd to be able to access the Pandas library.
#### STEP 2: Load the .csv file into the Data Frame
In order to load the .csv file into the Data Frame, the syntax "pd.read_csv('cars.csv')" has been utilized. After loading the data frame, it was assigned to variable named "cars".
